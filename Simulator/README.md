# CSCI 6461 Computer Simulator ‚Äì Part III

**Description**  
A Java-based simulator for the CSCI 6461 instruction set architecture (ISA), developed for CS6461 at George Washington University. This simulator executes all instructions defined in the ISA, with a GUI for loading and running machine code programs. Part III specifically demonstrates the execution of a full instruction set, TRAP and machine fault handling, and a functional memory/cache subsystem.

## üß† Features

- ‚úÖ **Full ISA Instruction Execution** ‚Äì Supports all standard instructions: load/store, arithmetic, jump, logical, shift/rotate, I/O, and TRAP.
- ‚úÖ **TRAP & Machine Fault Handling** ‚Äì Properly routes illegal opcodes and faults to memory-defined routines.
- ‚úÖ **Cache System** ‚Äì Fully associative FIFO-based memory cache.
- ‚úÖ **GUI Interface** ‚Äì Java Swing GUI supports file loading, register views, step/run control, and I/O.
- ‚úÖ **Program 2 Demonstration** ‚Äì Implements a word search in a paragraph, with full use of I/O, TRR, and conditional jumps.
